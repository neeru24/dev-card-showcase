# Stroop Effect Game

A web-based implementation of the classic Stroop Effect psychological test turned into an engaging game.

## Description

The Stroop Effect Game challenges players to identify the ink color of words, not the words themselves. This creates cognitive dissonance as the brain processes conflicting information, making it a fun way to experience this famous psychological phenomenon.
