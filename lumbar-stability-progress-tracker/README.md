## Scoring System

### Stability Score Calculation
- **Base Score**: Calculated from exercise performance (duration/reps)
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Penalty for higher perceived difficulty
- **Pain Adjustment**: Significant penalty for pain during exercise
- **Range**: 0-100 points

### Score Categories
- **80-100**: Excellent stability
- **60-79**: Good stability
- **40-59**: Fair stability
- **20-39**: Poor stability
- **0-19**: Very poor stability

### Risk Levels
- **Low Risk**: Good stability scores with minimal pain
- **Moderate Risk**: Average stability or mild pain
- **High Risk**: Poor stability scores or significant pain

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Warm Up**: Always warm up before stability exercises
2. **Form First**: Focus on proper form over duration/reps
3. **Pain Monitoring**: Stop if you experience sharp pain
4. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase difficulty as you improve
5. **Consistency**: Regular assessment (2-3 times per week)
6. **Professional Consultation**: Consult a healthcare provider for back pain

## Benefits

- **Injury Prevention**: Identify stability weaknesses before injuries occur
- **Progress Tracking**: Quantify improvements in core strength
- **Balanced Development**: Ensure symmetrical core development
- **Motivation**: Visual progress tracking keeps you engaged
- **Rehabilitation**: Useful for back injury recovery programs

## Safety Considerations

- **Medical Clearance**: Consult a doctor before starting if you have back issues
- **Proper Form**: Use mirrors or video to ensure correct technique
- **Gradual Progression**: Don't rush to advanced exercises
- **Listen to Your Body**: Pain is a signal to stop and reassess
- **Rest Days**: Allow recovery between intense stability sessions
