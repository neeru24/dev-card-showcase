  "description": "A daily Wordle-style puzzle for web developers. A mystery hex color is shown — you have 6 attempts to guess its exact 6-digit hex code. Each guess reveals warm/cool/exact feedback per R, G, and B channel independently.",
  "long_description": "Hex-Guess seeds a daily target color from the current UTC date so every player shares the same puzzle. The user submits hex guesses; Vanilla JS parses each into R, G, B channels and computes per-channel distance. Feedback tiles animate in with a Wordle-style flip reveal, colored by proximity: exact (green), hot (<15 off), warm (<40), cool (<80), cold (further). Direction arrows (↑/↓) hint which way to adjust each channel. Progress, win streak, and full guess history are stored in localStorage so the game survives page reloads.",
