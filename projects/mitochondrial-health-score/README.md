# 🧬 Mitochondrial Health Score

A comprehensive web-based tool for assessing and tracking mitochondrial health - the powerhouse of your cells. This tracker evaluates key lifestyle factors that influence mitochondrial function and provides personalized recommendations for optimal cellular energy production.

## Features

### Health Assessment
- **Exercise Tracking**: Monitor weekly exercise hours and intensity
- **Sleep Quality**: Rate sleep quality on a 1-10 scale
- **Diet Evaluation**: Assess intake of anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense foods
- **Stress Monitoring**: Track chronic stress levels
- **Supplement Tracking**: Monitor mitochondrial-supporting supplements (CoQ10, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, etc.)
- **Energy Levels**: Daily energy assessment

### Scoring System
- Comprehensive scoring algorithm (0-100 points)
- Real-time visual feedback with color-coded circular display
- Health interpretation based on score ranges

### Personalized Recommendations
- Priority-based recommendations (High, Medium, Low)
- Specific actionable advice for each health factor
- Evidence-based suggestions for mitochondrial optimization

### Progress Tracking
- Historical assessment data storage
- Trend visualization with interactive charts
- Statistics dashboard (average score, best score, total assessments)
- Recent assessments history

## How It Works

1. **Complete Assessment**: Fill out the comprehensive health questionnaire
2. **Calculate Score**: Get instant mitochondrial health score with interpretation
3. **View Recommendations**: Receive personalized advice for improvement
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor changes over time with charts and history

## Scoring Factors

- **Exercise** (0-50 points): Based on weekly hours, optimal 7-10 hours
- **Sleep Quality** (0-15 points): Higher quality = higher score
- **Diet Quality** (0-15 points): Anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense foods
- **Stress Level** (0-10 points): Lower stress = higher score
- **Energy Level** (0-5 points): Daily energy assessment
- **Supplements** (0-10 points): Mitochondrial-supporting supplements

## Health Score Ranges

- **80-100**: Excellent mitochondrial health
- **60-79**: Good health with room for improvement
- **0-59**: Needs attention and lifestyle changes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Local Storage for data persistence

## Usage

1. Open `mitochondrial-health-score.html` in a web browser
2. Complete the health assessment form
3. Click "Calculate Health Score"
4. Review your score, interpretation, and recommendations
5. Track progress over time with the charts and history
