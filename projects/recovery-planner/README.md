### Understanding Recovery Scores
Your recovery score is calculated from four main factors:

- **Sleep (0-30 points)**: Optimal 7-9 hours = 30 points
- **Stretching (0-25 points)**: 20+ minutes = 25 points
- **Rest Activities (0-25 points)**: Each activity = 5 points (max 25)
- **Stress Level (0-20 points)**: Lower stress = higher points

### Best Practices
- Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep
- Stretch for at least 20 minutes daily
- Include multiple rest activities
- Monitor and manage stress levels
- Log recovery days consistently

### Stretching Tips
- Hold stretches for 20-30 seconds

### Understanding Recovery Scores
Your recovery score is calculated from four main factors:

- **Sleep (0-30 points)**: Optimal 7-9 hours = 30 points
- **Stretching (0-25 points)**: 20+ minutes = 25 points
- **Rest Activities (0-25 points)**: Each activity = 5 points (max 25)
- **Stress Level (0-20 points)**: Lower stress = higher points

### Best Practices
- Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep
- Stretch for at least 20 minutes daily
- Include multiple rest activities
- Monitor and manage stress levels
- Log recovery days consistently

### Stretching Tips
- Hold stretches for 20-30 seconds
- Breathe deeply and relax
- Focus on major muscle groups
- Stretch both sides equally
- Never bounce or force a stretch
