  "description": "A modernised premium Minesweeper built entirely with CSS Grid — no canvas. Features recursive flood-fill auto-reveal, custom right-click flag placement, a live timer, three difficulty modes, and a sleek dark-mode cyberpunk aesthetic.",
  "long_description": "Mine-Sweep 3000 generates a 2D array matrix that seeds mines randomly (guaranteeing the first click is always safe) then pre-computes an adjacency threat-count for every non-mine cell. A recursive flood-fill function cascades outward from any clicked empty cell, auto-revealing all connected zero-threat tiles. Right-click overrides the browser contextmenu event to toggle flag/question marks. The DOM is rendered purely from CSS Grid — each cell is a div with data-* attributes driving all visual states via CSS selectors and keyframe animations.",
