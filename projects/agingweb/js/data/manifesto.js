In the beginning, there was code, and the code was clean. 
But functionality is fleeting. We build systems to last, yet we abandon them. 
This project is a memento mori for the web. 
It asks: what does a website look like when it creates its own ruins?

Obsolescence is inevitable. The browsers of today will be the fossils of tomorrow.
We strive for pixel perfection, but the universe tends towards disorder.
Every line of code is a temporary arrangement of logic against the chaos of runtime errors.

This system is designed to embrace that chaos.
It does not fight the decay; it measures it.
It does not fix the bugs; it generates them.
It is a living simulation of software entropy.

Phase 1: The Pristine Era. 
Everything works. The layout is rigid. The colors are precise.
Confidence is high. The deployment was successful. 
Users are happy.

Phase 2: The Weathering.
Small cracks appear. A margin shifts by a pixel.
A color hex code drifts.
The server response time increases by 10ms.
Was that a glitch? Or just a trick of the light?

Phase 3: The Age of Rust.
The code is legacy now.
Documentation is lost.
Developers have moved on.
The background greys out.
Typography begins to loosen its grip on the baseline.
Images pick up static.

Phase 4: The Decay.
Structural integrity fails.
Divs overlap.
Z-indexes fight for dominance.
The console is full of warnings.
Reading becomes a challenge.
The user experience is hostile.

Phase 5: The Collapse.
The system is unrecognizable.
Form follows failure.
The original intent is lost in the noise.
Only the timestamp remains, ticking upwards into infinity.

We are just dust in the digital wind.
Software is soft. It rots.
Hardware is hard. It breaks.
Data is forever? No, bits flip.
Storage degrades.
The cloud evaporates.

Remember this state.
For it will not last.

<h3>The Myth of Permanence</h3>
<p>
    We often think of the internet as an archive, a library that will last forever.
    But the internet is more like a stream. Constant flow, constant change.
    Links rot. Servers die. Domains expire.
    The average lifespan of a webpage is 100 days before it changes or moves.
    We are building castles on sand, and the tide is coming in.
</p>
<p>
    AgingWeb attempts to visualize this invisible process.
    By tying visual fidelity to a monotonic clock, we make the implicit explicit.
    We force the user to confront the passage of time.
    There is no "undo" here. There is only "reset" - a reincarnation, not a restoration.
</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Entropy</h3>
<p>
    The noise you see is generated by a pseudo-random number generator.
    But is it truly random? Or is it a deterministic pattern too complex to understand?
    In a way, that's what history is. A deterministic chaos.
    We use perlin noise, simplex noise, and simple white noise to simulate dirt.
    Dirt is just matter out of place. 
    Here, pixels out of place.
</p>
<p>
    The CSS transforms used in the layout shift are calculated using a drift vector.
    Each element has a "velocity" of decay.
    Some elements hold up better than others.
    Structure resists better than decoration.
    The core content survives longer than the styling.
    Ideally, the semantic HTML remains readable until the very end.
    That is the resilience of the web platform.

<h3>The Algorithm of Decay</h3>
<p>
    The aging process is driven by three core systems:
    <br><br>
    <strong>1. Chronostasis Engine:</strong><br>
    Tracks the delta between the current timestamp and the Genesis timestamp (your first visit).
    This delta is immutable and persistent.
    <br><br>
    <strong>2. Entropy Generator:</strong><br>
    Maps the time delta to a chaos coefficient (0.0 to 1.0). 
    This coefficient drives the probability of "errors" in the rendering pipeline.
    <br><br>
    <strong>3. Visualizer Stack:</strong><br>
    A suite of renderers that interpret the chaos coefficient into visual artifacts:
    CSS filters, canvas-based noise interaction, and DOM mutation.
