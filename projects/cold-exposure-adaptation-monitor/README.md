- **Temperature Tolerance**: Track the lowest temperatures you can comfortably handle

## 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

### Important Warnings
- **Consult a Doctor**: Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting cold exposure therapy
- **Start Slowly**: Begin with short exposures (1-2 minutes) and gradually increase
- **Listen to Your Body**: Stop immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort
- **Medical Conditions**: People with heart conditions, high blood pressure, or other health issues should avoid cold exposure

### Safe Practice Guidelines
1. **Warm Up First**: Ensure your body is warm before exposure
2. **Gradual Progression**: Increase duration/temperature by no more than 10-20% per week
3. **Hydration**: Stay well-hydrated before and after sessions
4. **Recovery**: Allow adequate recovery time between intense sessions
5. **Supervision**: Have someone nearby for longer or more intense exposures

### Emergency Signs
Stop immediately and seek medical attention if you experience:
- Chest pain or irregular heartbeat
- Severe dizziness or fainting
- Extreme shivering or inability to warm up
- Numbness or loss of sensation
- Confusion or disorientation
