  "description": "A minimalist one-button arcade game. Control a ship caught in gravitational orbit — press SPACE to break free and dash to the next planet. Master the timing, chain planets, and rack up your highest score.",
  "long_description": "Orbit-Dash uses a custom trigonometry engine built on Canvas 2D to compute smooth circular orbital motion via sine/cosine. A state machine cleanly transitions the ship between rotational (orbital) and linear (dash) physics on a single keypress. Planets are procedurally generated in world-space while a smooth-lerp camera tracks the action at 60 FPS via requestAnimationFrame.",
